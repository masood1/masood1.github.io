		 <h2>ABOUT</h2>
		 <div class="about-head">
			 <p>AMMAR KOORA LIVE aims to provide a professional player-focused approach. First-class player development is combined with the Dutch “total football” 
			 approach where each player is trained to move freely around the field, while still maintaining team structure. 
			 With European teaching methods we are creating total football players who have the opportunity to excel individually and yet be part of a high-performing team. Whether you are just starting out or are a seasoned player, then BCFC is the place for you. </p>

				 <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
				 <p class="abt-info">We believe that good nutrition and proper fitness are very important for the development of our players in order for them to reach the next level. Nutritional advice and help will be given to ensure that our players stay in top shape, physically and mentally. 

Cutting-edge fitness programs will be part of the weekly routine for strengthening and agility—all with the mindset of creating a total footballer. 

Besides focusing on technical skills for the field, we also strive to help our players learn the tactical side of football through field classes and seminars; both are necessary to become a total football player and to better understand the game.  

At BCFC we are committed to helping our players reach their top potential. With our approach to the beautiful game of football—and with connections inside India and around the globe—we are positioned well to have our players take the next step and to assist them along their journey.</p>

					 <h3>Our Values</h3>
					 <div class="value-grd">
						 <span>01.</span>
						 <h4>RESPECT</h4>
						 <p>Respect for others is one of the basic requirements of democratic life and the capacity to live in society. 
						 It affects the individual and has both a social and a collective dimension.</p>
					 </div>
					 <div class="value-grd">
						 <span>02.</span>
						 <h4>EFFORT</h4>
						 <p>There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate instead luck, opportunism and immediate triumph.
						 However, effort is a value that can take us to unthinkable heights and lead us to achieve targets and objectives 
						 that may at other times appear distant or inaccessible.</p>
					 </div>
					 <div class="value-grd">
						 <span>03.</span>
						 <h4>AMBITION</h4>
						 <p>Ambition is the desire to achieve the maximum performance and do things not only well but also as well as is feasibly possible and 
						 to improve every day. This value is applicable both to individuals and to groups.</p>
					 </div>
					 <div class="value-grd">
						 <span>04.</span>
						 <h4>TEAMWORK</h4>
						 <p>Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and that, as a member of the same, 
						 becomes an active element that acts on behalf of the whole (sometimes even to the determine of their own individuality). </p>
					 </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4 skills">
					 <h3>Our Anthem</h3>
					 <h4>A'El Cant del Barça' is not the first anthem that the Club has had during its long history.</h4>
					 <p>It was first performed on  27 November 1974, before the game that marked the end of the 75th anniversary celebrations. 
					 A choir of 3,600, conducted by Oriol Martorell, gathered on the pitch for the very first public performance of the new anthem. 
					 The words were written by Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas, and the music was composed by Manuel Valls. 
					 The song quickly grew in popularity. The fans loved the fact that they could clap their hands in time to its catchy rhythm, 
					 and the words perfectly depicted the values of supporting Barça, 
					 especially the spirit of welcoming outsiders into Catalan society, a spirit that is reflected all the way through the Club membership.</p>
					 <ul>
						<li><a href="#">"Can't Never Could and Never Will!"</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">Victories aren’t won like some prize on a T.V. game show; they are earned.</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">"Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right. "</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">Soccer is easy if you work hard at it.</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">Its ok to lose as long as you don’t lose the lesson.</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">80% to the ball is the same as 0% to the ball.</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#">“the more we practice, the luckier we get.”</a></li>
					 <li><a href="#"> "Pass unto others as you would have them pass unto you."</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>		
				<div class="col-md-4 testi">
					 <h3>Testimonals</h3>
				     <p>"Now it's more important to the fans than to the players as it is a chance to show our appreciation for 
					 what a player has done for us and the club.</p>
					 <a href="#">JOHN FRANKLIN</a>
					 <p>"The relationship between fans and players has changed, they are no longer the working class heroes who you would see in the pub after a game, 
					 now they are multi-millionaires and disconnected from the fans' lives so this is a chance for us to be bit more personal with them."</p>
					 <a href="#">TOM MENDERW</a>
					 <p>"He was their star player, and a former City hero, and was awarded the entire profit from the game. 
					 Unfortunately, the player and club were in dispute for years to come as Meredith felt he was never paid the full amount and cited this
					 as one of the reasons why he later returned to Manchester City."
